                stored, and otherwise processed when a person visits or uses the
                Site.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. It does not apply
                to third-party websites or services linked from the Site, which
                are governed by their own terms and privacy notices.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                The Site has no user accounts. A person does not provide a name,
                email address, or other account identifier to use a tool, and
                Tidalsoft does not maintain a profile that connects a person to
                their browser-local tool content.

                1.1 Tool Content
              </h3>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                The nine tools listed on the home page perform their text and
                data transformations in client-side browser code. Their current
                inputs and settings are written to same-origin{" "}
                <code>sessionStorage</code> so work can survive a reload in the
                same tab. Textytools does not automatically attach raw tool
                input or transformed output to application-authored analytics
                events or feedback submissions.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                Browser-local processing is not the same as zero retention or
                zero network activity. Section 2 describes browser storage, and
                sections 3 and 4 describe information transmitted through
                hosting, analytics, and feedback services.
              </p>

                1.2 Information Submitted Through Feedback
              </h3>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                The feedback form collects the name, email address, and message
                a person chooses to submit. Tool content is not attached
                automatically, but it becomes part of the feedback submission if
                the person includes it in the message.

                1.3 Automatically Collected Information
              </h3>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                When a person visits the Site, hosting and analytics services
                may process technical and usage information such as IP address,
                requested URL, date and time, referrer, browser and device
                information, approximate location, page views, interactions, and
                cookie or similar identifiers.

            </section>

            <section className={sectionClass}>
              <h2 className={headingClass}>2. Browser Storage</h2>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                The nine catalogued tools keep current content and settings in
                same-origin <code>sessionStorage</code>. This state is kept in
                the applicable tab for the browser session. Browser session
                restoration may extend that lifetime, so Textytools does not
                promise an exact automatic deletion time.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                Supported cross-tool actions place content in a one-time
                session-storage transfer key. The destination tool removes that
                transfer key after reading it and may then keep the content as
                its own temporary tool state.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                A tool&apos;s Clear control removes its current content but may
                retain tool preferences. Browser site-data controls can remove
                all stored content and settings for the Site.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                A small number of directly reachable, non-catalogued
                experimental pages currently save documents in same-origin{" "}
                <code>localStorage</code>. Those records remain until they are
                deleted in the page where a delete control is available or
                removed through browser site-data controls. They are not account
                records and are not synchronized by Textytools.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                Browser extensions, device backups, browser synchronization, and
                clipboard history are controlled by the applicable browser or
                device, not by Textytools.

              </h2>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                Vercel hosts the Site. Loading a page or calling the feedback
                endpoint sends ordinary request information to Vercel, including
                technical information needed to deliver, operate, diagnose, and
                protect the Site. Provider-controlled logs and security systems
                may retain this information under Vercel&apos;s practices. For
                more information, see the{" "}

              <h2 className={headingClass}>4. Analytics and Cookies</h2>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                The production Site uses Google Analytics to understand Site and
                tool usage. Google Analytics loads network resources, sends
                measurement requests, and may set or read analytics cookies such
                as <code>_ga</code>.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                Textytools application-authored events may include the page URL
                and path, tool name, interaction type, selected modes or
                options, source and destination tools, and some exact
                interaction counts. Google may process additional information
                through its automatic measurement and cookie behavior. Google
                describes that processing in its{" "}

              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                Tidalsoft does not send a visitor&apos;s name, email address,
                raw tool content, or a Textytools account identifier to Google
                Analytics. Tidalsoft does not maintain a lookup that connects
                Google&apos;s browser or device identifiers to an identified
                person. Analytics activity therefore cannot ordinarily be found
                in response to a request made only with a person&apos;s name or
                email address.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                A person can restrict or remove cookies and other site data
                using browser settings or content-blocking controls. The Site
                does not currently display a separate cookie-consent manager.
                Where applicable law requires consent before non-essential
                analytics cookies are used, the analytics configuration remains
                subject to that requirement.

              <h2 className={headingClass}>5. Feedback Communications</h2>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                Submitting feedback sends the provided name, email address, and
                message to the Textytools feedback endpoint. The endpoint passes
                that information to Resend for email delivery and then to the
                configured Textytools mailbox. Resend and the receiving email
                provider also process delivery and operational metadata.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                Tidalsoft may retain feedback to respond, operate the Site, and
                maintain a record of the communication. A person should not
                submit passwords, access tokens, confidential tool content, or
                other information they do not want included in that
                communication. For more information about the delivery provider,
                see the{" "}
                <a
                  className={linkClass}

              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                Because a feedback message contains the submitted name and email
                address, it is the information Tidalsoft can ordinarily locate
                by a person&apos;s identity. Sending feedback is optional and is
                not required to use any tool.

                Tidalsoft processes the information described in this Privacy

              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                Tidalsoft discloses information to service providers as
                necessary for Site hosting and security, analytics, email
                delivery, and related operations. The current service-provider
                boundaries are Vercel, Google Analytics, Resend, and the
                configured receiving email provider.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                Tidalsoft may also disclose information where reasonably
                necessary to comply with applicable law or legal process;
                protect the rights, safety, and security of Tidalsoft, the Site,
                or others; investigate fraud or abuse; or complete a corporate
                transaction subject to appropriate legal requirements.

              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                The Site does not currently run an advertising-network
                integration or serve targeted advertising. The deployed
                application has no advertising or data-sale integration. Google
                Analytics nevertheless receives the information described in
                section 4, and the legal characterization of a disclosure may
                depend on applicable law and provider configuration.

                Browser-held tool content can be removed as described in section
                2. Analytics and infrastructure information follow the
                applicable account settings and provider retention practices.
                Feedback is not covered by a promised automatic deletion
                schedule and may be kept for the purposes stated in this Privacy
                Policy.
              </p>
              <p className={paragraphClass}>
                A person may request deletion of identifiable information that
                Tidalsoft controls by using the contact information in section
                15. Tidalsoft may retain information where necessary or
                permitted for legal obligations, security, fraud prevention,
                dispute resolution, or the establishment, exercise, or defence
                of legal claims.

                The Site limits disclosure of tool content by processing the

                attaching raw tool content to application-authored analytics
                events or feedback. Tidalsoft also relies on access controls,
                deployment practices, and provider safeguards. No method of
                transmission, browser storage, or electronic storage is
                completely secure, and Tidalsoft cannot guarantee absolute
                security.

                Subject to applicable Canadian privacy law, a person may ask
                whether Tidalsoft holds personal information about them and, if

                challenge its accuracy or completeness, request an appropriate
                correction, withdraw consent where processing depends on
                consent, or challenge Tidalsoft&apos;s compliance with
                applicable privacy obligations. If Tidalsoft holds no personal
                information about the requester, the response will say so.

                If no responsive information can be identified, Tidalsoft will
